# DotaSlider

## What is this?

A Sveltekit Dota 2 Project

I really wanted the old functionality in Dota 2, where you could use your mousewheel to scroll through the heroes; or click and drag them.

Here is a start, I'm hosting it in Vercel. If you'e like to contribute send me a message on github and I'll add you as a contributor

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
